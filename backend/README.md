# Backend placeholder

The KleineWelt backend could not be cloned automatically because outbound HTTPS access to GitHub is blocked by a proxy (HTTP 403 on CONNECT).

Once network access is available, run the following command from the repository root to populate this directory:

```bash
scripts/clone-kleine-welt-backend.sh https://github.com/denn18/KleineWelt.git
```

After cloning, verify the directory structure and ensure any `.env.example` files are present.
